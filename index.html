    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h3>Data Analysis with Python (Winter 2023)</h3>
        <p>Developed a Python script for basic data handling and analysis. Utilized popular libraries such as R and Matplotlib to read, manipulate, and visualize data. Loaded a sample dataset (e.g., CSV or Excel file) and performed basic statistical analysis, including mean, median, and standard deviation calculations. Created visualizations such as bar charts or scatter plots to represent key insights from the data.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Chat Application (Winter 2023)</h3>
        <p>Developed a real-time chat application in C, utilizing socket programming for communication. Implemented features such as private messaging, group chat, and file-sharing functionality, showcasing proficiency in network programming and interprocess communication.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Tetris Game Simulator (Fall 2023)</h3>
        <p>Created a fully functional Tetris game using Java, utilizing JavaFX for the game's graphical user interface and integrating both front-end and back-end development. Implemented the classic game mechanics such as tetrominoes movement, rotation, collision detection, and scoring system.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Huffman File Compression and Decompression (Fall 2022)</h3>
        <p>Designed and implemented a Huffman coding algorithm in Python for lossless compression of text data. Developed a frequency-based tree structure, utilizing a priority queue, and applied Huffman coding principles to generate compressed binary representations for each character in the input.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Boggle Game Simulator (Winter 2022)</h3>
        <p>Developed the core backend logic for a Boggle game simulator in Java, including the grid generation, word validation, and scoring mechanisms. Implemented an efficient algorithm for word searching on the game grid, ensuring optimal performance even for large boards, and integrated scoring rules for different word lengths. Designed and implemented the graphical user interface (GUI) using JavaFX with features such as the game board display, timer, score tracking, and user input for word submissions, showcasing proficiency in both Java programming and UI/UX design.</p>
